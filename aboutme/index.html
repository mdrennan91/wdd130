    <h2>Mitchel Drennan</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Mitchel Drennan, I live in the beautiful state of Washington, and I'm currently single with no children. I was born and raised in the church, and as you might be able to tell from looking at me, I fell away from the church for some time and never served a mission. I'm now back to being an active member and currently teach primary. My hobbies include hiking, photography, and playing video games.</p>
    <p>I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in software development from BYU-I. I originally went to school for automotive technology and after working many years in the automotive industry, I decided to change career paths and go back to school for software development. I currently work from home doing application software support for a small company based out of Michigan. At work I do QA, end-user documentation, and smoke testing. I'm hoping to eventually gain the skills and knowledge I need to move up to a developer position after graduation.</p>
    <p>I'm thankful for the opportunity to be here and look forward to learning what this class has to offer!</p>

        About Me 
        <br>
        My name is Mitchel Drennan and I am located in the state of Washinton. I'm an avid photographer with a relentless passion for capturing the essence of vehicles. Over the past seven years, I have immersed myself in the art of photography, constantly refining my skills and exploring various genres. However, it was automotive photography that truly ignited my creative spark and allowed me to fully express my vision.
        With an unwavering love for anything on wheels, I am dedicated to bringing these magnificent machines to life through my lens. From the sleek lines of exotics to the raw power of muscle cars, I thrive on capturing their unique personalities and showcasing them in all their glory. It's a fulfilling journey that never ceases to amaze me.
        Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to explore different branches of photography, including portraits and nature. These experiences have contributed to my growth as an artist, providing me with a diverse skill set that complements my automotive work. Drawing inspiration from the natural world and the human spirit, I bring a fresh perspective to every shoot.
        I have collaborated with prestigious car clubs, sharing my passion with fellow enthusiasts. Whether it's an exhilarating nighttime shoot, capturing the motion of a moving vehicle, or curating a themed photoshoot to showcase its personality, I'm committed to delivering captivating images that exceed expectations. 
        <br><br>
        While I am based in the state of Washington, I am thrilled to offer my services beyond this region. 
        I love exploring new locations, discovering breathtaking scenery, and capturing stunning automotive moments in different settings. Whether you have a scenic spot in mind or a particular event you'd like me to cover, I am available to travel for photoshoots. From coastal drives to scenic mountain roads, I'm willing to go the extra mile to ensure your vision is brought to life.
        Please keep in mind that travel expenses, including transportation and accommodation, may apply for shoots located outside the eastern Washington area. However, rest assured that I will work closely with you to make the process as seamless as possible, ensuring that every detail is taken care of and your experience remains exceptional.
        Don't let distance limit your imagination. Let's collaborate and create stunning automotive imagery, no matter where your inspiration takes us. Contact me to discuss your ideas and let's embark on an exciting photographic adventure together.
        <br><br>
        Equipment
        <br>
        When it comes to equipment, I rely on the exceptional capabilities of my trusted Nikon D7200. Alongside a collection of carefully selected lenses, I ensure that every detail is impeccably captured. 
        To further enhance the quality and bring out the full potential of each photograph, I professionally edit all my images using Adobe Lightroom, adding that extra touch of magic.
        <br><br>

        to reach out. I'm always ready to connect with fellow car enthusiasts and potential clients. You can contact me via (email? phone number? contact form? still deciding. rough draft)

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        For the home page hero images I want to use two images that compliment each other rather than one large hero image. 
        I'm not sure if these will look better side by side or one above the other. If both options look strange I will go back to one large hero image. I will have hover events for the all nav bar links along with the book now button and footer social media icons. 

      </p>
      <img src="images/home_page_wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Gallery</h3>
      <p>         
        I'm not sure how many pictures the final photo gallery will have. I have around 18 pictures for the gallery page but the wireframe was extending too far for a good screen shot so it appears long and narrow compared to the "home" and "about me" pages. 
        I know I want to keep the gallery down to a basic photo grid but I'm not sure the exact dimensions of each photo so the grid style might change.
      </p>
      <img src="images/gallery_page_wireframe.png" alt="page 2 wireframe">

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>         
        The final layout of this third "About Me" page might change. I wasn't sure if I wanted a partial overlap of the images with the text boxes for equipment and contact.
        Nav bar links, footer social media icons, and "book now" button will all have hover events.
